## ‚öôÔ∏è Initial Setup & Configuration

### First Run Setup

When you run the application for the first time, it will create a settings folder and copy configuration files:

**Windows**: `%USERPROFILE%\AppData\Local\iPhotoDownloader\`
**Linux**: `~/.local/share/iphoto-downloader/`

The following files will be created:
- `settings.ini` - Your configuration file (edit this)
- `settings.ini.template` - Template file (don't edit)
- `README.md` - Documentation

### Basic Configuration

1. Navigate to your settings folder
2. Open `settings.ini` in a text editor
3. Configure the essential settings:

```ini
# Essential Settings
SYNC_DIRECTORY=/path/to/your/photos
DRY_RUN=true
LOG_LEVEL=INFO

```

### Sync Directory Setup

Choose where your photos will be stored:

**Windows Examples:**
```ini
SYNC_DIRECTORY=C:\Users\YourName\Pictures\iCloudSync
# or
SYNC_DIRECTORY=D:\Photos\iCloud
```

**Linux Examples:**
```ini
SYNC_DIRECTORY=/home/username/Pictures/iCloudSync
# or
SYNC_DIRECTORY=/media/external/Photos/iCloud
```

**Important**: Use forward slashes (/) even on Windows for cross-platform compatibility.

## üîë Credential Management

The application supports two methods for storing credentials:

### Method 1: Secure Keyring Storage (Recommended)

Use the credential manager to store credentials securely in your system's credential store:

```bash
# Windows
iphoto_downloader_credentials.exe

# Linux
./iphoto_downloader_credentials
```

The credential manager will guide you through:
1. **iCloud Credentials**: Store your iCloud username and app-specific password
2. **Pushover Credentials**: Store Pushover API tokens for notifications
3. **Credential Verification**: Test stored credentials
4. **Credential Management**: View, update, or delete stored credentials

#### Creating iCloud App-Specific Password

1. Go to [Apple ID account page](https://appleid.apple.com/)
2. Sign in with your iCloud credentials
3. Navigate to "Security" ‚Üí "App-Specific Passwords"
4. Generate a new password with label "iPhoto Downloader"
5. Use this password (not your regular iCloud password)

### Method 2: Environment Variables

Add credentials directly to your `settings.ini`:

```ini
# iCloud Credentials
ICLOUD_USERNAME=your.email@icloud.com
ICLOUD_PASSWORD=your-app-specific-password

# Pushover Notifications (Optional)
PUSHOVER_USER_KEY=your-pushover-user-key
PUSHOVER_API_TOKEN=your-pushover-api-token
```

**Security Note**: Keyring storage is more secure as credentials are encrypted by your operating system.

## üìÅ Album Filtering Configuration

Control which albums are synced from your iCloud account:

### Basic Album Configuration

```ini
# Include personal albums (created by you)
INCLUDE_PERSONAL_ALBUMS=true

# Include shared albums (shared with you by others)
INCLUDE_SHARED_ALBUMS=true
```

### Album Allow-Lists

Specify exactly which albums to sync:

```ini
# Only sync specific personal albums
PERSONAL_ALBUM_NAMES_TO_INCLUDE=Family Photos,Vacation 2024,Work Events

# Only sync specific shared albums  
SHARED_ALBUM_NAMES_TO_INCLUDE=Shared Family,Trip Photos,Wedding Album
```

**Notes**:
- Leave allow-lists empty to include all albums of that type
- Album names are case-sensitive
- Use comma separation for multiple albums
- Photos from each album are stored in separate subfolders

### Album Folder Structure

Photos are organized by album:
```
üìÅ SYNC_DIRECTORY/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ üìÅ Family Photos/
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ IMG_001.jpg
‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ IMG_002.jpg
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ üìÅ Vacation 2024/
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ IMG_003.jpg
‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ IMG_004.jpg
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ üìÅ Shared Family/
    ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ IMG_005.jpg
    ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ IMG_006.jpg
```

### Album Configuration Examples

**Sync everything:**
```ini
INCLUDE_PERSONAL_ALBUMS=true
INCLUDE_SHARED_ALBUMS=true
PERSONAL_ALBUM_NAMES_TO_INCLUDE=
SHARED_ALBUM_NAMES_TO_INCLUDE=
```

**Personal albums only:**
```ini
INCLUDE_PERSONAL_ALBUMS=true
INCLUDE_SHARED_ALBUMS=false
```

**Specific albums only:**
```ini
INCLUDE_PERSONAL_ALBUMS=true
INCLUDE_SHARED_ALBUMS=true
PERSONAL_ALBUM_NAMES_TO_INCLUDE=Family,Vacation
SHARED_ALBUM_NAMES_TO_INCLUDE=Wedding Photos
```

---

## üóÑÔ∏è Database Configuration

The application uses SQLite to track downloaded photos and prevent duplicates.

### Database Location Options

#### Option 1: Default Location (Recommended)
```ini
DATABASE_PARENT_DIRECTORY=.data
```
Creates: `SYNC_DIRECTORY/.data/deletion_tracker.db`

#### Option 2: Absolute Path
**Windows:**
```ini
DATABASE_PARENT_DIRECTORY=C:\Users\YourName\AppData\Local\iPhotoDownloader\Database
```

**Linux:**
```ini
DATABASE_PARENT_DIRECTORY=/home/username/.local/share/iphoto-downloader/database
```

#### Option 3: Environment Variables

**Windows:**
```ini
DATABASE_PARENT_DIRECTORY=%LOCALAPPDATA%\iPhotoDownloader\Database
```

**Linux:**
```ini
DATABASE_PARENT_DIRECTORY=$HOME/.local/share/iphoto-downloader/database
```

### Cross-Platform Environment Variables

The application automatically handles environment variable differences:

| Variable | Windows | Linux/macOS |
|----------|---------|-------------|
| `%LOCALAPPDATA%` | `C:\Users\User\AppData\Local` | `~/.local/share` |
| `%USERPROFILE%` | `C:\Users\User` | `~` |
| `%APPDATA%` | `C:\Users\User\AppData\Roaming` | `~/.config` |

### Database Safety Features

- **Automatic Backups**: Created before each sync
- **Corruption Recovery**: Automatic restore from backup if database is corrupted
- **Integrity Checks**: Regular database health checks in continuous mode

## üîê 2FA Authentication Setup

The application provides a web-based interface for Two-Factor Authentication.

### Pushover Notifications Setup

For convenient 2FA notifications, set up Pushover:

1. **Create Pushover Account**: Go to [pushover.net](https://pushover.net)
2. **Get User Key**: Found on your dashboard
3. **Create Application**: Create a new application for "iPhoto Downloader"
4. **Get API Token**: Copy the API token for your application

**Configuration:**
```ini
PUSHOVER_USER_KEY=your-user-key-here
PUSHOVER_API_TOKEN=your-api-token-here
PUSHOVER_DEVICE=your-device-name  # Optional: specific device
```

### 2FA Web Interface

When 2FA is required:

1. **Notification**: You'll receive a Pushover notification (if configured)
2. **Web Interface**: A local web server starts at `http://localhost:5000`
3. **Authentication**: Enter your 2FA code in the web interface
4. **Session Storage**: Sessions are stored securely in your user directory

### 2FA Troubleshooting

**Port Conflicts**: The application automatically tries different ports if 5000 is occupied.

**Browser Issues**: The web interface is designed for modern browsers. If you experience issues:
- Try refreshing the page
- Check browser console for errors
- Ensure JavaScript is enabled

**Session Problems**: Clear old sessions using the credential manager:
```bash
iphoto_downloader_credentials
# Choose option 4: "iCloud - Delete 2FA sessions"
```

## ‚ùì FAQ

### General Questions

**Q: Is this application safe to use?**
A: Yes. The application only downloads photos and never deletes anything from your iCloud account. All operations are read-only on the iCloud side.

**Q: Will this duplicate photos I already have?**
A: No. The application tracks downloaded photos and skips files that already exist locally.

**Q: What happens if I delete a photo locally?**
A: The application remembers deleted photos and won't re-download them, respecting your local deletion decisions.

**Q: Can I sync multiple iCloud accounts?**
A: Yes, by using separate sync directories and configuration files, or by allowing multiple instances.

### Technical Questions

**Q: Where are my credentials stored?**
A: When using keyring storage, credentials are encrypted by your operating system's credential manager (Windows Credential Manager, macOS Keychain, or Linux Secret Service).

**Q: Can I run this on a server?**
A: Yes, but you'll need to handle 2FA authentication. Consider using continuous mode for automated syncing.

**Q: How much disk space do I need?**
A: This depends on your iCloud library size. The application shows download progress and you can set size limits.

**Q: Can I sync only new photos?**
A: Yes, the application only downloads photos that don't exist locally and haven't been previously deleted.

### Configuration Questions

**Q: How do I sync only specific albums?**
A: Use the album filtering configuration to specify exactly which personal and shared albums to include.

**Q: Can I change the sync directory after initial setup?**
A: Yes, but you'll need to either move existing photos or start fresh with a new database.

**Q: How do I backup my settings?**
A: Copy your `settings.ini` file and optionally the database file for a complete backup.

### Troubleshooting Questions

**Q: The 2FA web page won't open**
A: Check if another application is using port 5000, or access the interface directly at `http://localhost:5000`.

**Q: I'm getting "Another instance is running" error**
A: Set `ALLOW_MULTI_INSTANCE=true` in your configuration, or make sure no other instance is actually running.

**Q: Photos are downloading but to the wrong location**
A: Check your `SYNC_DIRECTORY` setting and ensure the path exists and is writable.
